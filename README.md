# TypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by `Microsoft` in `2012` it adds `strongly static typed` with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. Because TypeScript is a `superset of JavaScript`, all JavaScript programs are syntactically valid TypeScript, but they can fail to type-check for safety reasons.

The TypeScript compiler, named `tsc`, is written in TypeScript. As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser). The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler. It is also available as a Node.js package that uses Node.js as a host.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. 

The compiler can "target" a particular edition of ECMAScript (such as ES5 for legacy browser compatibility), but by default compiles to the latest version. 

TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js, Deno or Bun). Multiple options are available for `transpilation`. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used,or the `Babel compiler` can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript. 

TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js library modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.

## TS File Extentions

A filename extension or file extension is a `suffix` to the name of a computer file (for example, .txt, .docx, .md). The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A filename extension is typically delimited from the rest of the filename with a full stop (period), but in some systems it is separated with spaces.  

File Extensions tell your computer which application created or can open the file and which icon to use for the file. For example, the docx extension tells your computer that Microsoft Word can open the file and to display a Word icon when you view it in File Explorer.

Typescript extentions are `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`
